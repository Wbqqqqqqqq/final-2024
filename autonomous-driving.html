                <h2>What is Vehicular Automation?</h2>
                <p>Vehicular automation refers to the use of technology to assist or replace the operator of a vehicle, such as a car, truck, aircraft, rocket, military vehicle, or boat. Vehicles that require human intervention are semi-autonomous, while those that can operate without a human operator are considered fully autonomous. The degree of autonomy may vary depending on conditions, and autonomy is enabled by advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) with varying capabilities.</p>

                <h2>Related Technologies</h2>
                <p>To enable vehicular automation, several technologies are involved. These include advanced software, high-definition maps, modifications to the vehicle itself, and support from external infrastructure and services.</p>

                <h2>Challenges of Autonomy</h2>
                <p>Autonomy introduces various challenges across different modes of travel, such as road, air, and marine travel. Roads present the greatest complexity due to the unpredictability of the environment. Factors like diverse road designs, changing traffic conditions, obstacles, and geographical or cultural differences all influence the performance of autonomous vehicles.</p>

                <h2>Responsibility of the Vehicle</h2>
                <p>With autonomy, the vehicle is tasked with all perception, monitoring, and control functions. This means that the vehicle must be fully responsible for navigating and responding to its environment without human intervention.</p>
